# Problem Statement

Artists in Kenya and other creatives do not have a place to list their artwork so that the online users can see and purchase. Art work is typically available in art galleries and shows but these are inaccessible, yet technology has made it possible for creatives to show their work through sites like Pinterest, not to mention sites that use NFT technology such as Opensea and Momint. 

# Solution

A nft marketplace is an inspiration for this project, but remains out of the scope of this project for now. My solution is to create a single page application where someone can post their art, drawing, picture, or graphic design.

## MVP

<ul>
<li>
Landing page
</li>
<li>
Marketplace
</li>
<li>
Contact form
</li>
<li>
Upload Form
</li>
</ul>

## How to Use the App

When you open the app on this link https://starlit-seahorse-a2ab4a.netlify.app/ you get to a landing page. Here you choose whether to upload a pic or work of art from your computer to the marketplace. Alternatively, you can choose to go straight to the Marketplace and see the pics there. 

You can switch through 3 pages on the navbar. However the content for this pages remain work in progress. Much of this remains work in progress.
