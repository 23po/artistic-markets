## Project Owner: Calvin Kodalo

## Project Name: Online Art Marketplace

# Problem Statement

Artists in Kenya and other creatives do not have a place to list their artwork so that the online users can see and purchase. Art work is typically available in art galleries and shows but these are inaccessible, yet technology has made it possible for creatives to show their work through sites like Pinterest, not to mention sites that use NFT technology such as Opensea and Momint. 

# Solution

A nft marketplace is an inspiration for this project, but remains out of the scope of this project for now. My solution is to create a single page application where someone can post their art, drawing, picture, or graphic design.
